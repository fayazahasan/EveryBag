In this experiment I have taken the files as it is, split them into a training and a test set and run it through my CNN.
The test accuracy I acheive on doing that is close to 90%.
But I would not go by this accuracy as the images in each class are not evenly distributed, even in the test set. 
Some training statistics are shared as images.
