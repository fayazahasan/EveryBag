In this experiment I have used augmented images on both training and test set.
First the dataset was split into trianing and testing images.
Next these images were augmented.
This lead to the creation of a test set which was equally spaced in terms of number of images per class.
However the accuracies I got using this method was less than 60%.
I arrived at a conclusion that the images in the dataset are not equal.
Augmenting the dataset will not be able to improve accuracies as augmentation by a multiple of 20 creates different images, but it does not give the network to learn much.
In conclusion, this problem will be better solved if we had similar number of images per class.
Some training statistics are uploaded as images.
